The goal of this lab is to configure a HashiCorp vault in such a way that will provide authentication for a web application API.

This can be achieved by creating a KV - Secrets Engine whose contents will be compared with what the user sends in the authentication header.

If there is a positive match, the API GET request is authenticated by the secrets engine; if there is no positive match, then the request is classified as unauthorized.

Solution

Log in to the servers using the credentials provided:

ssh cloud_user@<PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS>
Log in with the Root Token and Unseal the Vault

In the Vault Server, unseal the vaults:
vault operator unseal
<UNSEAL_KEY_1>
vault operator unseal
<UNSEAL_KEY_2>
vault operator unseal
<UNSEAL_KEY_3>
Log in with the Initial Root Token:
vault login
<INITIAL_ROOT_TOKEN>
Enable vault secrets and Limit its Access

Enable the kv store:
vault secrets enable -path=api-keys kv
Generate a random hash:
echo -n "fieahthtr6hjywjgaiwogjiogj" | sha256sum -
Create the api-key:
vault kv put api-keys/key01 API-01=<RANDOM_HASH_OUTPUT>
Create a policy for the access token:
vim api-policy.hcl
In the new document, paste the following:
path "api-keys/key01"{
  capabilities = ["read"]
}
Save the policy:
ESC
:wq
ENTER
Write the policy:
vault policy write api-policy api-policy.hcl
Create an access token:
vault token create -policy="api-policy" -format=json | jq
Copy the client_token for later use.
Copy the Vault Server domain name:
cat Domain
In the Client server, test the access token:
curl -H "X-Vault-Token: <CLIENT_TOKEN>" http://<VAULT_SERVER_DOMAIN_NAME>/v1/api-keys/key01 | jq
Clone the Github Repo, Modify the App Code, and Run the App on the Web Server

In the Web Server, clone the GitHub repository:
git clone https://github.com/ErminLA/HashiCorp-Vault.git
Install pip for python3:
sudo apt install python3-pip
Install Django framework for the current user:
pip3 install Django --user
Open the settings.py file:
vim /home/cloud_user/HashiCorp-Vault/ACG/settings.py
Add the Web Server host to the allowed hosts:
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ["<WEB_SERVER_PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS>"]
Save the file:
ESC
:wq
ENTER
Open the views.py file:
vim /home/cloud_user/HashiCorp-Vault/ACG_Login/views.py
In the get_token() function make the following changes:
url = "<VAULT_SERVER_DOMAIN_NAME>/v1/api-keys/key01"
hdr = { 'X-Vault-Token' : <CLIENT_TOKEN> }
Save the file
ESC
:wq
ENTER
Test out the API call

Change to the HashiCorp-Vault/ directory:
cd /home/cloud_user/HashiCorp-Vault/
Run the Django app:
python3.6 manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8080
Make a test call from the Client Server
curl -H "Auth-Token: <RANDOM_HASH_OUTPUT>" <WEB_SERVER_PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS>:8080/api_auth_test
