In this scenario, we are working in a DevOps position and received a task to install and set up HashiCorp Vault in the company cloud. The manager forgot to inform us in time, so now we have about two hours before the presentation meeting to set this up and make a good impression.

Use dig to get the domain name of the server:

dig -x <SERVER_PUBLIC_IP>
Solution

Log in to the server using the credentials provided:

ssh cloud_user@<PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS>
Download, Unpack, and Move Consul to the Bin Directory

Download Consul:

wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/consul/1.7.3/consul_1.7.3_linux_amd64.zip
Install unzip and unpack Consul:

sudo apt install unzip
unzip consul_1.7.3_linux_amd64.zip
Move consul executable to the bin directory:

sudo mv consul /usr/bin
Test it out!

consul
Create a Consul systemd Service

Create a systemd service:

sudo vim /etc/systemd/system/consul.service
Click Remove unprintable when prompted.

Get the IP address of the server:

ip addr show
Paste in the configuration. Replace IP.ADDRESS.OF.SERVER with the internal IP address of the server:

[Unit]
Description=Consul
Documentation=https://www.consul.io/
[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/consul agent -server -ui -data-dir=/temp/consul -bootstrap-expect=1 -node=vault -bind=IP.ADDRESS.OF.SERVER -config-dir=/etc/consul.d/
ExecReload=/bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID
LimitNOFILE=65536
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
To quit:

Hit ESC
Type :wq
Hit ENTER
Create a directory for configuration files:

sudo mkdir /etc/consul.d
Create a configuration for UI:

Note: This step is optional.

sudo vim /etc/consul.d/ui.json
{
"addresses": {
"http": "0.0.0.0"
}
}
To quit:

Hit ESC
Type :wq
Hit ENTER
Reload, start, enable, and verify the new service:

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start consul
sudo systemctl enable consul
sudo systemctl status consul
Move Vault to the Bin Directory and Create a Configuration File

Download Vault:

wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/vault/1.5.0/vault_1.5.0_linux_amd64.zip
Unpack Vault:

unzip vault_1.5.0_linux_amd64.zip
Move Vault binary to the bin directory:

sudo mv vault /usr/bin
Create a directory for the configuration file and populate it:

sudo mkdir /etc/vault/
sudo vim /etc/vault/config.hcl
Click Remove unprintable when prompted.

Get the IP address of the server:

ip addr show
Insert the configuration. Replace Consul.IP.ADDRESS with the Consul IP address:

storage "consul" {
    address = "Consul.IP.ADDRESS:8500"
    path = "vault/"
}
listener "tcp" {
    address = "0.0.0.0:80"
    tls_disable = 1
}
ui = true
To quit:

Hit ESC
Type :wq
Hit ENTER
Create a systemd service:

sudo vim /etc/systemd/system/vault.service
Click Remove unprintable when prompted.

[Unit]
Description=Vault
Documentation=https://www.vault.io/

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/vault server -config=/etc/vault/config.hcl

To quit:

* Hit **ESC**
* Type **:wq**
* Hit **ENTER**
Reload, start, enable, and verify the new service:

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start vault
sudo systemctl enable vault
sudo systemctl status vault  
Get the domain name of the server:

dig -x <SERVER_PUBLIC_IP>
Set the Vault address:

export VAULT_ADDR="http://<DOMAIN_NAME>"
echo "export VAULT_ADDR=http://<DOMAIN_NAME>" >> ~/.bashrc
Set up autocomplete:

vault -autocomplete-install
complete -C /usr/bin/vault vault
Test It Out!

Initialize the Vault:

vault operator init
Note: It is important to save the keys and root token. If lost, access to the Vault will be lost.

vault operator unseal <KEY_1>
vault operator unseal <KEY_2>
vault operator unseal <KEY_3>
Log in to the Vault:

vault login <TOKEN>
